	<h1>Raising Backyard Chickens</h1>
	<h3>Watching Backyard Chicken Television Is a Zen Experience</h3>
<p>I never thought I would say this but I like watching my chickens play together. They are funny and each of them have different ‘personalities’. They chase each other, push each other around, fly up in the air a few feet and drop down, roll in the dirt, scratch and peck, etc. Sitting on the porch and looking at them makes me happy for some reason. Maybe it reminds me of simpler times, or lets me daydream about living on a farm — I don’t know. Either way, I like it.</p>
